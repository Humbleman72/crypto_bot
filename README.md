# crypto_bot

### Binance crypto bot
- Logger/screener (doesn't need a Binance account).
- Wallet/trader (needs a Binance account).
- Should run on different machines (it circumvent API limits by IP).
- Provide your API key only on the trading machine (follow install instructions).

#### Instructions.

- View install folder for fully-automated server install scripts.
- The notebook is for component tests.
- Run bootstrap.sh on the server after installing (screener part).
- The trader part (wallet) can run locally, or on a server, using the crypto logger py file, after install/ conda part.

#### Disclaimers.

- Warning: You are responsible for your own trading losses!
- This was not intended to be public, but Binance is ceasing operations in my country.
- I do not intend to upgrade or document, but I remain available for questions.
- Website and MQTT was firestorm22. The rest was me (abstractguy).
